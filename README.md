# coursework-mooc-2016

Decided to do a online java course so i won't forget everything i've learned in the past.

DoD: Implementation passes unit tests

Notable exercises can be found at last exercise of each week (week 7 and forward)

Exercises above are larger than most found in the course. Most of the exercises above are self-designed (program structure, implementation). User interface and what the program should do are predefined in exercise by the course. A few exercises contain some example implementation as a base and objective of the exercise has been to expand the implementation further.
